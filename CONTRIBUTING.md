## Contributing to YTracing
First off, thank you for considering contributing to YTracing! It's people like you that make YTracing such a great tool.

We welcome any form of contribution, including but not limited to:

* Reporting a bug

* Discussing the current state of the code

* Submitting a fix

* Proposing new features

* Becoming a maintainer

### How to Contribute
#### Reporting Bugs
Bugs are tracked as GitHub Issues. Before opening a new issue, please perform a quick search to see if the problem has already been reported. If it has, please add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.

When you are creating a bug report, please include as many details as possible. Fill out the required template, the information it asks for helps us resolve issues faster.

#### Suggesting Enhancements
If you have an idea for a new feature or an improvement to an existing one, please open an issue and use the "Feature Request" template. This allows for a discussion of your proposal before you put significant effort into it.

#### Submitting Pull Requests
We love pull requests! To submit one, please follow these steps:

* Fork the repository and create your branch from main.
* Make your changes in your forked repository.
* Ensure the code compiles and runs. Please test your changes with the provided main example and the YViewer tool.
* Adhere to the coding style (see below).
* Write clear and concise commit messages.
* Push your changes and open a pull request. Please provide a clear description of the problem and your solution, including the relevant issue number if applicable.

### Coding Style
Consistency is key. We follow these general C++ style guidelines:

* C++ Standard: The project uses C++17. Please make use of its features where appropriate.

* Naming:

  * ClassName and EnumName use UpperCamelCase.

  * functionName and variableName use lowerCamelCase.

  * private_member_variables_ end with an underscore.

* Braces: Use K&R style (opening brace on the same line).

    ``` C++
    if (condition) {
    // do something
    }
    ```


* Indentation: Use 4 spaces for indentation, not tabs.

* Comments: Use comments to explain complex logic, but strive to make the code self-documenting first.

We recommend using a tool like clang-format to help you maintain this style.

Thank you again for your contribution!
